    "1. Increasing Effectiveness of Diagnostic Processes<br>\n",
    "One reason to implement AI in healthcare is to improve diagnostic effectiveness. Large caseloads and a lack of medical history may increase the possibility of human error in healthcare settings. In comparison to clinicians, AI systems can detect and diagnose diseases quicker and with minimal risk of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reducing Overall Healthcare Costs<br>\n",
    "AI can be employed to make diagnosis processes more efficient, which in turn, reduces the total cost of healthcare procedures. For example, consider a case when AI can scan through millions of diagnostic images to look for disease symptoms. It eliminates the need for expensive manual labor. Moreover, patients can receive faster and more effective care, which reduces the need for hospital admissions and long waiting periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Safer Surgeries<br>\n",
    "By offering effective and distinctive aid in surgery, AI is establishing a position for itself in healthcare robotics. AI’s ability to perform less invasive surgical procedures that might otherwise require open surgery provides a wide range of benefits to patients, such as reduced blood loss, decreased infection risk, and less pain after surgery. Moreover, due to AI’s capacity to offer more precision while operating on delicate organs and tissues, patients need smaller incisions and also experience reduced scarring and faster recovery times.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easy Information Sharing<br>\n",
    "The ability of AI algorithms to analyze vast amounts of information quickly is the key to fulfilling the potential of this technology in precision medicine. For instance, currently, 11.3% of the American population has diabetes. The condition has to be treated and managed urgently, and AI can assist healthcare professionals in understanding the disease through data via a real-time glucose monitoring system."
